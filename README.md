# slog-aws-lambda

This project leverages the new [structured logging package](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@master) from Go.  
This package was introduced in [Go 1.21 release](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.21).

The idea is to provide a log handler that will use the attributes present in the lambda context.  

Also the format is Json.
